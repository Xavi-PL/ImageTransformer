# ImageTweakerTool
Simple tool to edit images. The user uses JFileChooser to choose the image, transforms it to 256x256 pixels, 1:1 ratio and centers it. Finally it saves it in a local directory. Ideal for profile pics and cloud storing with low filesize.

## EXAMPLE:
#### BEFORE (3840x2160px, 16:9 ratio & 2,11MB):
